Finance-IBrokers-MooseCallback

This module is a Moose implementation of the Callback illustrated 
in the Finance::InteractiveBrokers::TWS documentation. It provides
stub methods and data structures for many of the functions of the 
java API. Implementing with Moose provides understandable parameter
names. 

This module is in early development. It is a generalization of 
some code I developed for my own use. Updates are welcome.
